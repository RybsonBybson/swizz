# Swizz 🚀 — All Your Favorite Online Tools in One Place

**Swizz** is a compact desktop app designed to bring together a variety of popular online tools — so you don’t have to keep jumping between different websites and apps. Everything you need, bundled in one convenient place.

### 🧰 What does Swizz offer?

- YouTube video downloader  
- Audio and video transcription (Transcryption)  
- _(Coming soon: file conversion, voice recording, meme generator, music maker, AI background remover, and many more!)_

### 🛠️ Project Status

At the moment, Swizz includes two working tools:
1. **YouTube Downloader**  
2. **Transcryption** — automatically turns speech in audio/video files into text

This is a personal project I’ve been building in my free time.  
Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit burnt out and uncertain about whether I’ll continue developing it actively — but I’d love to see others build on it, improve it, and take it further.
